## Introduction 
This is our research to develop a method to help people estimate body fat percentage to help them assess health. We conducted statistical analysis over the data of a group of peopleâ€™s body information and worked out a linear model to estimate the body fat percentage.

## Project Detail
This project includes the following:
- Two-Page Summary
- `mod2.R` in `Code` folder is the code used to produce all the analysis
- `Graphs` folder which includes all the graphs and tables produced when running R file 
- `app.R` in `Shiny` folder which is the code used to create the calculator app
- `BodyFat.csv` in `Data` is the dataset that we analyzed

# Instruction
To reproduce the result, run `mod2.R` in RStudio. 
Note that the result might be slightly different at the training steps because of the `set.seed()` function, as it may vary on different versions of R and different computers.
